These are the fundamental record types used to support the higher level messaging protocol.

The ID numbers used are scraped from ActiveMQ's value for them but through experience it has been
discovered that these IDs do not have to match AMQ's since it never reads this low level detail
except in their own journal implementations. Due to a lack of a good reason to change them
they've been left as is though.

Codes above 100 are system level administrative codes used for non-functional features.
